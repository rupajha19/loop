# Now, we will make a game using loops. We will call this game a guessing game.

# 1

# In this game we take any number, let us suppose this number is number 5.

# 2

# After this we take any number as an input from the user between 1 to 10. The user tries to guess
#  this number.

# 3

# Suppose the user gives 3as an input. We will then check if 3 is equal to 5 or not?

# 4

# 3 is not equal to 5 so we will ask the user for another input.

# 5

# Now, we will check if that number is equal to 5 or not.

# 6

# User will get 5 chances to guess.
